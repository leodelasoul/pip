  # Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement C==2.0.0 (from a)
  # Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement C==1.0.0 (from b)
  # No matching distribution found for c, c
  # -- This is a bit confusing, as both versions of C are available.
  # -- better would be something like:
  # A 1.0.0 -> B 1.0.0 -> C 1.0.0
  # A 1.0.0 -> C 2.0.0
